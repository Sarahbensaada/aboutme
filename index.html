    <h2>Funny story</h2>
    <p>A long a time ago I was applying for a job at NMBS to work as a train conductor. 
        It was part of a job day so in the morning they gave us a tour around in the headquarters. 
        In the afternoon they interviewed all the candidates. 
        It was not a one-on-one interview, it was like with 6 jury members. 
        6 tired, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, old white men. So you can imagine my stress level. 
        Everything went fine until they switched the conversation to French. All hell went loose, in my head at first and then everywhere else.
        I can speak French well, I just forgot how to speak, I started talking and immediately saw one of the members rolling their eyes and sighing. 
        I lost it, I dont know how I figured out how to get out of there with amazing speed, I had a big bag and a big coat. 
        Went to the bathroom to cry and just basically hoped to stay there until it was over. Someone ran after me to console me, it was a woman, thankfully, telling me not to take it personally blablabla. 
        I went back home with deep shame. 6 months later I managed to get a job at the airport so screw you NMBS and your trains, I work for planes now! </p>
